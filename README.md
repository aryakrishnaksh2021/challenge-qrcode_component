## My process
I started with bulding the layout of the design using HTML elements, then adding style class to each element. After that, I added the media query for the responsive design.Finally done the lighthouse audit for the performance and accessibility. Then made changes according with the best practices.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I learned more about the flex properties and gap  property in CSS, as well as how to use them effectively for layout. I also practiced using media query.
